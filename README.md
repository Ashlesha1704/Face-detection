# Face and Eye Detection with Closed Eyes and Covered Face Detection

This project utilizes OpenCV to perform facial and eye detection on images. It uses Haar Cascade Classifiers to detect faces and eyes within the images and provides additional functionalities such as detecting if the eyes are closed or if the face is covered (e.g., by a mask).

### Features:
1. **Face Detection**: Detects faces in images using Haar Cascade Classifiers (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`).
2. **Eye Detection**: Detects eyes within the detected face region using Haar Cascade Classifiers (`haarcascade_eye.xml`).
3. **Closed Eyes Detection**: Flags faces where no eyes are detected as having "closed eyes" or obscured eyes.
4. **Covered Face Detection**: Flags faces as "covered" (e.g., by a mask) if no eyes are detected within a recognized face region.
5. **Multi-image Support**: Processes multiple images uploaded by the user and provides feedback for each one.

### Installation:
To run this project, ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install OpenCV via pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-python-headless
```

### Usage:
1. **Upload Haar Cascade Files**: The project requires the Haar Cascade XML files for face and eye detection (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` and `haarcascade_eye.xml`), which should be uploaded before running the program.
2. **Upload Images**: Upload one or more images for processing. The program will detect faces, check for eyes, and provide output regarding closed eyes or covered faces.
3. **View Results**: After processing, the program will display the detected faces and indicate whether the eyes are closed or the face is covered.

### Workflow:
1. The program first detects faces in the image.
2. For each detected face, it checks if any eyes are detected within the face region.
3. If no eyes are detected, the program will flag the face as "Eyes Closed" or "Face Covered."
4. The results are displayed for each image.

### Limitations:
- The eye detection might fail in some cases, such as when the person is looking away, blinking, or if the image quality is poor.
- Masked faces or faces with glasses might not be detected accurately, depending on the classifierâ€™s limitations.
  
### Future Improvements:
- Enhance eye closure detection by incorporating machine learning or deep learning-based techniques (e.g., facial landmarks, pupil detection).
- Improve covered face detection by considering more advanced models or integrating additional facial features (e.g., nose, mouth).
  
### Demo:
You can upload images and see results for yourself. The program provides a simple yet effective way to detect faces with closed eyes or covered faces.
